# Node Operator / Validator

Validators secure the relay chain by staking DOTs, validating proofs from collators and participating in consensus with other validators.

These participants will play a crucial role in adding new blocks to the Relay Chain and, by extension to all parachains, such that parties can complete cross-chain transactions via the Relay Chain. Validators perform two functions. First, verifying the information contained in an assigned set of parachain blocks is valid (such as the identities of the transacting parties and the subject matter of the contract). Their second role is to participate in the consensus mechanism to produce the Relay Chain blocks based on validity statements from other validators. Any instances of non-compliance with the consensus algorithms result in punishment by removal of some or all of the validatorâ€™s staked DOTs, thereby discouraging bad actors. Good performance, however, will be rewarded, with validators receiving transaction fees in the form of DOTs in exchange for their activities.

## How to run a polkadot / validator node

!!! info
    _This tutorial works with current Alexander testnet and has been updated for PoC-4._

To be a good validator, you should

* Have certain amount of DOT stake (**Basic Requirement**)

* Keep your node up to the latest version

* Have enough knowledge on network security to create a robust network

* Use HSM (Hardware Security Module) to protect your key (**Highly Recommend**)

You should **NOT** run a validator if you have DOTs, but you do not have enough technical knowledge to set up a validator. It is recommended to delegate / nominate your DOTs to someone you trust for helping you to do this kind of work. 

As a nominator, you can still get the rewards by nominating multiple validators. If you want to know more about nominator, please see [here](./nominator.md).

For this tutorial, we use Ubuntu 18.04 and will be running on PoC-4 Alexander testnet. No matter what operating system you are using, setup should not be too much difference. There is a lot of [VPS](./node-operator.md#vps-list) choice out there, feel free to pick one you like.
 
!!! attention
    _Please make sure that you do **NOT** use this setup & configuration on mainnet. This guide simply walks you through step-by-step how to set up & run a validator node. If you would like to run a validator seriously when mainnet is live, you have to be REALLY careful on some areas like key management, DDOS protection and high availability._

**Install rust**

```bash
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
sudo apt install make clang pkg-config libssl-dev
```
This command will fetch the latest version of Rust and install it, then execute the second command to install required software before install Polkadot.

```bash
rustup update
```
If you have installed rust already, run this command to check whether there is a new version available.

**Install polkadot PoC-4 Alexander**

Until support for the one-line installer is back up for PoC-4, you will need to build `polkadot` from source.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot.git
cd polkadot
cargo clean
git checkout v0.4
./scripts/init.sh
./scripts/build.sh
cargo install --force --path ./ --branch v0.4.3
```

This may take a while depending on your hardware!

**Synchronize chain data**

After installing all related dependencies, you can start your polkadot node. Start to synchronize the chain by executing the following command:

```bash
polkadot --chain alex
```

It should take at least few hours.

You can check the current highest block via [Telemetry](https://telemetry.polkadot.io/#/Alexander) or [PolkadotJS Block Explorer](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer)
 
**Create accounts**

To be a validator, you also have to create two separate accounts for managing your funds, namely `Stash` and `Controller`. If you want to know more about it, please see [here](../learn/staking.md#accounts). 


![create account](../../img/validator/polkadot-dashboard-create-account.jpg)
First, go to [PolkadotJS => Account](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/accounts) & click *Create account* tab, then input your account name, save the seed, and input your password for this account. 

![backup seed](../../img/validator/polkadot-dashboard-backup-seed.jpg)

You can then click *Save* and choose *Create and backup account* to store your seed file to other place.


Repeat the above steps to create one more account.


**Get testnet DOTs token**

To continue the following steps, you are required to get some testnet DOTs token for `Stash` and `Controller` account in order to submit transactions and stake to be a validator.

Please go to [Polkadot Watercooler - Riot](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#polkadot-watercooler:matrix.org) channel, paste your account address to ask for testnet DOTs.
 
You can also get some small testnet DOTs on [Blockxlabs](https://faucets.blockxlabs.com/polkadot) as well ;)


**Pair Accounts**

First, go to [Staking](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/staking/actions) section, you should see all of your existing accounts.

When you have made a decision which account you will be using to be stash, you can click `Set Session Key` and then submit a transaction.

After the transaction has gone through successfully, you should see there is a `Bond` button. Click it and then select your another account which you just created before to be a controller that is mainly for managing account operations.  

![dashboard bonding](../../img/validator/polkadot-dashboard-bonding.png)

**Value boned** - how many DOTs you want to bond to this controller for staking

**Payment destination** - where your rewards get sent

If everything is inputted properly, click `Bond`.


**Staking** 

Once the transaction is successfully executed, you should see the controller has `Validate` and `Nominate` options available.

![dashboard validate](../../img/validator/polkadot-dashboard-validate.png)

Select `Validate`. 

![dashboard staking](../../img/validator/polkadot-dashboard-staking.png)

**Unstake threshold** - after your validator have been reported to be offline a number of times, you will be slashed

**Payment preferences** - rewards you will get before splitting to your nominators

Click `Stake`

Open your terminal, if your node is fully synchronized, run your validator with the `Controller` seed.

```bash
polkadot --validator --key CONTROLLER_SEED --name SHOW_ON_TELEMETRY
```

Then go to [Telemetry](https://telemetry.polkadot.io/#/Alexander), after wait few seconds, your node information will be shown.

![telemetry monitor](../../img/validator/telemetry_monitor.jpg)


Go to Staking tab, you should see a list of active validators out there. At the top of the page, it shows how many validators slots are available and how many nodes are intended to be a validator.


![staking queue](../../img/validator/polkadot-dashboard-staking-queue.png)


Your node will be shown on the *next up* queue. In next era(probably 1 hour), if there is slot available, your node will become an active validator. 

**Congratulations!**

> If you want to run your validator as a systemd process see the short guide [below](#running-your-validator-as-a-systemd-process).

**Notice:** As mainnet get closer, you can expect more slots will be available for testing.

## Running your validator as a systemd process

You can run your validator as a [systemd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd) process so that it will automatically restart on server reboots or crashes (and helps to avoid getting slashed!).

First create a new unit file called `polkadot-validator.service` in `/etc/systemd/system/`.

```bash
touch /etc/systemd/system/polkadot-validator.service
```

In this unit file you will write the commands that you want to run on server boot / restart.

```
[Unit]
Description=Polkadot Validator

[Service]
ExecStart=PATH_TO_POLKADOT_BIN --validator --key YOUR_SEED --name SHOW_ON_TELEMETRY
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

To enable this to autostart on bootup run:

```bash
systemctl enable polkadot-validator.service
```

Start it manually with:

```bash
systemctl start polkadot-validator.service
```

You can check it's working with:

```bash
systemctl status polkadot-validator.service
```

You can tail the logs with `journalctl` like so:

```bash
journalctl -f -u polkadot-validator
```
