# DOT

## What are DOTs?

DOT is the native token of the Polkadot network in a similar way that BTC is the native
token of Bitcoin or Ether is the native token of the Ethereum Blockchain.

Currently, DOTs are the integer numbers. You can compare them to Satoshis or Wei.

## Testnet DOTs

DOTs are required to make transactions on the Polkadot network. Testnet DOTs do not have any value beside allowing you to experiment with the network.

### Getting testnet DOTs

You can ask someone to send you testnet DOTs on the [Polkadot Watercooler](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#polkadot-watercooler:matrix.org).

You can make your own DOTs by [becoming a validator](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/wiki/Validating-on-PoC-2).
