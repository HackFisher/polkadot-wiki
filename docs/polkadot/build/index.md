    _üèóÔ∏è Polkadot is under construction, these documents will rapidly change._

Welcome to the build section of the Polkadot wiki.

Here you will be able to find the most up-to-date information
on the status of the development tools in the ecosystem. We are
always adding new tools and frameworks as we learn about them
so if you are working on something that should be included please
reach out to us on [Riot](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#polkadot-watercooler:matrix.org).

This section of the wiki is divided into three parts: the first
part takes the shape of a technical guide that will get you quickly
up to speed with developing for Polkadot. The second part is an
up-to-date catalogue of developer tooling. The third part is a
resource which will contain some deeper technical information
that is not available to be found elsewhere.
